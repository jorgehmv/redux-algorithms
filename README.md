# Redux Algorithms

This is a simple visualization of sorting algorithms made with Redux. 
A [demo](https://redux-algorithms.herokuapp.com/) is running in Heroku.

My main goal building this website was to learn Redux, 
if you're learning too I recommend taking a look at [react-redux-universal-hot-example](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example). 
I implemented lots of features based on that template such as:
 - Universal rendering
 - Integration with Express
 - Webpack
 - Local styles and Sass
 - ESLint

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running Dev
```bash
npm run dev
```
